# Mortgage-Lending-and-Racial-Disparities
This study investigates racial disparities in mortgage lending, focusing on factors affecting loan approval.

**Introduction**

The Mortgage Disclosure Act (MDA), also known as the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), aims to ensure transparency and accuracy in mortgage lending by requiring lenders to disclose key mortgage terms and costs to borrowers. Despite government claims of non-discrimination, evidence suggests racial bias may persist. This study investigates racial disparities in mortgage lending, focusing on factors affecting loan approval.

**Dataset**

We utilized data from the American Economic Review 86, published in 1996 by Alicia H. Munnell et al., to analyze mortgage lending decisions based on race and creditworthiness. The dataset includes 1936 observations and covers variables such as credit history, loan amount percentage, debt-to-income ratio, marital status, race, and gender.

**Econometric Models and Estimation**

Our analysis examines loan approval, considering variables like credit history, loan amount percentage, debt-to-income ratio, marital status, race, and gender. We employed both Logit and Probit models to assess the impact of these variables on loan approval. The models explain 35% of the variation in loan approval decisions. 


**Conclusion**

This study identifies predictors of loan approval and highlights racial disparities in mortgage lending. Lenders should consider credit history, marital status, and loan amounts when making decisions and address potential biases. While these findings shed light on fair lending practices, a larger dataset and broader analysis are needed for comprehensive insights.
